## Unreleased

### The extraction finishes

- **A stock consumer's `check all` exited 2.** `KNOWN_GATES` named thirteen gates and five
  dispatched; three of the eight phantoms (`uid`, `tres`, `props`) sat in the DEFAULT roster, so
  the path a new adopter takes was the broken one and the error message named the gate it had
  just refused as a known one. The roster is now `doc`, `shell`, `repo-hygiene`, `pm`, `hooks`,
  with `doc` + `shell` as the default. **A repo pinning a removed gate in `[checks] all` gets
  exit 2 naming it** — that is the intended adoption step, not drift.
- **`_check_module` is derived from the roster** rather than an `if` chain beside it, so the two
  cannot disagree, and `tests/test_gate_roster.py` asserts `roster == dispatchable` by asking the
  function instead of restating the answer. The test is the change; the pruning is the small half.
- **`--help` listed ~14 verbs this package does not route** — the scene family, which left with
  the Godot half. `_usage()` prints that text on any typo, so a mistyped command handed the reader
  a menu of nothing. `tests/test_cli_surface.py` parses the verb list back out of the docstring
  and asserts both directions.
- **`src/agentic_sdlc/data/classdb.json` is gone** — 129,490 bytes of Godot ClassDB with zero
  readers, inside the wheel root, downloaded on every cold `uvx` resolve. So are `RETARGET_FLAG`,
  two orphaned `.tscn` fixtures, and `tests/support.temp_repo()`.
- **`README.md`'s install pin said `@v0.24.0`** — `godot-devkit`'s tag, on a copy-pasteable line.
  It names this package's own tag now. The scene-introspection and scene-surgery tables, the
  uid-in-refs migration appendix and the ClassDB regeneration steps are gone with the code.
- `CLAUDE.md` hard rule 2 is the rule this package holds — pure text, boots nothing — and records
  that its own *"if that stops being true, it leaves"* clause fired in 0.2.0, in the other
  direction: the scene half left and the repo family kept the pinned-tag channel.
- `devkit.toml` drops `[uid]`, `[tres]` and `[props]`.

- **This repo is the agentic half of `godot-devkit`, extracted at that project's `v0.24.0`.** SDLC, CI,
  hooks, the PM tree, installables and release automation; no Godot knowledge of any kind. The split was
  the code's own — there were ZERO imports between `godot-devkit`'s `repo/` and `godot/` halves in either
  direction, and its checks had already sorted themselves by side with nobody enforcing it. The shared
  substrate (~440 lines of config + tracked-file walking) is DUPLICATED rather than extracted to a third
  package or depended upon across the boundary; if both kits stay config-forward and that surface grows,
  the answer becomes a published shared config utility.
- **Version restarts at 0.1.0 and the PM tree starts empty.** The inherited `0.24.0` was another
  artifact's number, and `godot-devkit`'s roadmap is that project's story. Its history stays there.
